"""Walk-forward rolling windows: the previous paper's protocol, with the leak removed.

The previous paper trained on five consecutive 1,500-hour windows and tested on the
next one, rolling forward one window at a time and retraining at every step:

    for i in range(len(dfs_list) - 5):
        uni_train = concat(dfs_list[i : i+5])
        uni_test  = dfs_list[i+5]

That design was sound and is what a liquidity provider actually runs: refit on recent
history, deploy on what comes next. The defect was never the rolling window. It was
that `optimize_ppo` received `uni_test` and returned the reward ON IT as the Optuna
objective, so the tuning maximized test reward, INSIDE each rolling step. The single
chronological 50/25/25 split that briefly replaced this removed the leak by removing
the protocol, which also opened a multi-year gap between fitting and testing that the
original never had, and then made the resulting failure to generalize look like a
property of the problem.

The fix keeps the rolling window and carves validation out of the TRAINING block:

    train  windows i .. i+3     6,000h    fit here
    val    window  i+4          1,500h    select here; test is not a parameter
    test   window  i+5          1,500h    read once, then roll

Each window is therefore tested exactly once, by a policy fit only on data preceding
it, with the gap between fitting and testing held to one window. Both arms, learned
and heuristic, get the identical treatment at every step.

## Running it

One WORK UNIT is one (pool, rolling step): 144 of them on the core panel, and no unit
depends on any other. A unit writes a self-describing JSON result and is skipped if
that file already exists, so a run is resumable and a laptop and the cluster can
write into the same directory.

    # everything, here
    python -m ...experiments.rolling --out outputs/rolling_v1

    # one shard of eight (the laptop path; run the other shards elsewhere)
    python -m ...experiments.rolling --out outputs/rolling_v1 --shard 0 --of 8

    # a SLURM array maps $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID onto the SAME index
    sbatch scripts/slurm/rolling_array.sh          # see that file

    # read whatever has landed and print the table
    python -m ...experiments.rolling --out outputs/rolling_v1 --aggregate

    Two defects this replaces, both of which rigged the comparison AGAINST the agent
    while `bakeoff` and `agent_arm` asserted the budgets were matched:

    1. The config was hardcoded (`learning_rate=3e-4, ent_coef=0.01`) and the
       validation score was computed and then DISCARDED. The agent searched exactly
       ONE configuration while `ReactiveRecentering` searched 27 and the heuristics
       searched 48 between them. The previous paper had the opposite bias (10 Optuna
       trials for PPO against a competitor with no free parameters at all); replacing
       one rigged comparison with its mirror image is not a fix.

    2. The agent fit on `train` only, so its data ended one window BEFORE its test
       window, while every heuristic selected on `val`, i.e. right up to the test
       boundary. Under this project's own diagnosis, that a regime shift between
       selection and test is what breaks a learned policy, that asymmetry pointed
       straight at the result. Refitting on train+val after selection costs nothing,
       restores the previous paper's 7,500h fitting block, and puts both arms'
       information on the same footing.

    Refit from scratch every step: carrying weights forward would make the effective
    training set the whole history and quietly undo the walk-forward.
