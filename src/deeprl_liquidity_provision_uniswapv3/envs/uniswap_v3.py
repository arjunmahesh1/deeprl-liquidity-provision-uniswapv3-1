"""Uniswap v3 concentrated-liquidity environment, rebuilt on real pool flow.

What changed from the previous environment, and why each mattered:

1. `delta` was one variable carrying two incompatible conventions: a percent that
   keyed tick spacing (0.05 -> 10) and a fraction used as the fee rate. Passing the
   true 0.0005 raised in the tick lookup, so the pools charged 5% and 30%. Split
   into `fee_tier_pct` and `fee_rate`, which can never be confused.

2. Fees came from price displacement, i.e. arbitrage flow only, on a dataset with
   no volume. Measured: fee income was ~1.5% of impermanent loss, so the reward was
   ~-IL and there was nothing to trade off. Fees are now the LP's share of the
   hour's real gross fees, earned only while in range:
       fee = fees_usd * our_L / (pool_L + our_L)
   Measured after the change: fees are 14% to 60% of IL. That share term also
   retires the sole-provider assumption in the same expression.

3. Rebalancing re-derived liquidity from `xt` alone and carried `yt` over unchanged,
   with no swap; the out-of-range branch did `xt = xt/2; yt = xt*pt`, manufacturing
   the missing side. Rebalancing is now value-conserving: the position is valued,
   a swap fee and slippage are charged, and the new liquidity is solved from the
   remaining value.

4. Forced repositioning was free, because the gas indicator read the original
   action. There is no forced repositioning now: an out-of-range position simply
   stops earning, which is what actually happens on-chain. Only a chosen rebalance
   costs gas.

5. Fees were credited on an hour-boundary range check: in range at the end of the
   hour meant the whole hour's aggregated fees, out of range meant zero. With ~250
   swaps an hour a narrow band crosses in and out repeatedly inside one hour, so
   that rule charged zero for hours we earned through, and it charged it harder the
   narrower the band. It biased against concentration, which is the strategy this
   paper is about, and the bias was large enough to move the optimum: scaling fee
   income by two moved the best passive width from a degenerate +/-170% band to a
   realistic +/-5% one. Fees are now attributed PER SWAP, against each swap's own
   price interval and its own active liquidity. The agent still decides hourly (or
   at whatever cadence its schedule imposes); only the accounting is finer.

Conventions. L and sqrt-prices are RAW (matching the pool's `liquidity` column, so
the share is a legitimate ratio); token amounts are decimal-adjusted for value;
value is USD via the panel's `token0_usd` / `token1_usd`.

        A swap has EXTENT in price, not a location: the event reports the price after
        the swap, so the swap traversed [sqrt_lo, sqrt_hi] from the previous swap's
        price. A band covering part of that interval was the active liquidity for
        only part of the swap, and earns that part of the fee. Uniswap v3 credits fee
        growth per unit of liquidity as the price crosses each initialized tick
        (`SwapMath.computeSwapStep` runs once per tick range), so the fee a position
        earns is the portion of the swap that executed inside its own range.

        The fee is levied on the INPUT leg, so the fraction of the fee a sub-interval
        carries is the fraction of the INPUT it absorbed, and which measure that is
        depends on the direction. Over a step at constant L the two legs are
            token1 in:  dy = L * d(sqrtP)          -> linear in sqrtP
