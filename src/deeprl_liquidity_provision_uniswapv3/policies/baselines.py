"""The paper's four competitor strategies, ported to the rebuilt environment.

Functional forms and parameter grids follow the originals in
``baseline_strategies.py`` so the comparison stays with the paper's own
competitor set. Three things about the originals do not carry over, and each was
a defect rather than a design choice:

1. **They selected on the test window.** Each `evaluate()` swept its parameters and
   returned the argmax on the same segment it was scored on. Here a policy is a
   plain callable; parameter selection happens once on VALIDATION, in the runner,
   with the same budget PPO gets.

2. **PassiveWidthSweep swept nothing.** It filtered candidates to those present in
   `env.action_values`, and on WETH the intersection of `range(20,201,10)` with
   `[0,45,50,55]` was the single width `[50]`. The sweep is over a real grid here.

3. **Widths were snapped to a 4-element action grid** that Optuna had itself chosen
   by test reward, so the closed-form widths collapsed onto 0/45/50/55. Widths snap
   to whatever grid the run declares, and the grid is a pre-registered choice.

`base_factor` converts a volatility into a width. The originals used 100 against an
hourly `ew_sigma` of ~0.006, which lands on ~1, whose nearest action on the
`[0,45,50,55]` grid is 0: DO NOTHING. So the two "adaptive" baselines barely ever
acted. That is kept, because it is the competitor the paper actually ran. It is also
worth knowing when reading the paper's tables: of its four competitors,
`PassiveWidthSweep` swept a single width on WETH and `VolProportionalWidth` and
`ILMinimizer` mostly held. `base_factor` is exposed so a non-degenerate version can be
swept deliberately and reported as an addition rather than smuggled in as a fix.

Sigma throughout is `env.ew_sigma`, the EWM standard deviation of LOG returns with
alpha=0.05, which is the series the originals read (`custom_env.py:122`). It is not
`env.vol`, the 24h rolling standard deviation of simple returns, which belongs to the
rebuilt `compact` state and is a different number.

    The previous paper's grid is `action_values = [0, 45, 50, 55]`, and its 0 means "do
    nothing": `custom_env.py` only recentres `if action != 0`. Its
    `_nearest_action_index` therefore chooses between 0 and the three real widths, and a
    computed width below ~22 maps to "do nothing".

    Dropping the 0 from the candidate list, as an earlier version of this file did,
    silently deletes that option: every computed width, however small, is forced onto a
    real band. Combined with a `base_factor` large enough to overshoot the grid, it
    forces the WIDEST band every time, and then `VolProportionalWidth(k=3)` and
    `VolProportionalWidth(k=15)` are the same policy scoring the same reward with one
    distinct action. A ten-configuration "grid" that is one policy is not a grid, and a
    selection over it is not a selection.

    Widths here are in whatever unit the env reads them in (`width_units`), so this
    stays a like-for-like comparison against `action_widths`.

    `base_factor=100` is the original's, and its own comment calls it "converts sigma
    into tick units (adjust empirically)". It was never adjusted. Against an hourly
    `ew_sigma` of ~0.006 it computes `int(3 * 0.006 * 100) = 1`, whose nearest action on
    the `[0, 45, 50, 55]` grid is 0, i.e. DO NOTHING. So the paper's

    was compared against, not something to quietly repair: raising base_factor to make
