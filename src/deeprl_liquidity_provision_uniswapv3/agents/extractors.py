"""The previous paper's policy network, ported.

Its runner did NOT use a default MLP. It built PPO with a `CustomMLPFeatureExtractor`
(`rl-code/custom_env_folder/custom_env.py:545-566`) whose first layer is a
non-affine BatchNorm over the raw observation:

    BatchNorm1d(obs_dim, affine=False)
      -> Linear(obs_dim, h[0]) -> act
      -> Linear(h[0], h[1])    -> act
      -> Linear(h[1], features_dim)

with `features_dim=128`, `hidden_dim` from the Optuna-selected `dim_hidden_layers`
(default `[4, 2]`), and `activation` from the config (default `tanh`).

That BatchNorm is load-bearing, not decoration. The paper's state carries raw prices
(~2,000), raw liquidity, and unscaled TA-Lib indicators on wildly different scales.
Handing that to SB3's default `MlpPolicy`, which has no input normalization, is a
different agent, and it is the one this rebuild has been running while claiming to
compare against the paper's.

Two faithful details worth keeping rather than silently improving:

- `affine=False`, so there are no learnable scale/shift parameters here.
- The original hardcodes exactly TWO hidden layers by indexing `hidden_dim[0]` and
  `hidden_dim[1]`, so a 3-element `dim_hidden_layers` from its own Optuna search
  space (`[4,4,4]`, `[6,6,6]` are both in the YAML) silently drops the third layer.
  Replicated: a 3-layer config in the previous paper's search space never built a
  3-layer net, and reproducing its behaviour means reproducing that too.
